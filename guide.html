			<h3>Keystone: Grasp of the Undying</h3>
			<img id="rune-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/grasp-of-the-undying.png" alt="Grasp of the Undying">
			<p>Every 4 seconds in combat, Grasp of the Undying empowers 
			your next auto attack. It will deal bonus Magic damage based 
			on your max health, heals you based on your max health, 
			and permanently increases your max health. This is an ideal 
			keystone for Camille. It helps make Camille, who is a relatively
			fragile fighter, more durable. The empowered auto attack also
			synergises well with Camille's short trade and empowered auto 
			attack playstyle. </p>
			
			<h3>Shield Bash</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/shield-bash.png" alt="Shield Bash">
			<p>Shield Bash gives you bonus resistances while shielded. 
			It also empowers your next auto attack. This synergises with
			Camille's passive, which shields her briefly when she auto 
			attacks an enemy champion. It triggers often and fits with 
			Camille's empowered auto attack playstyle.</p> 
			
			<h3>Second Wind/Bone Plating</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/second-wind.png" alt="Second Wind">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/bone-plating.png" alt="Bone Plating">
			<p>Second Wind heals you over time after taking damage from 
			enemies. Bone Plating reduces the damage of the next 3 spells
			or attacks being triggered by taking damage (initial damage 
			not reduced). Second Wind favours lanes where you are taking 
			a lot of poke damage whereas Bone Plating is better against 
			lanes that want to go all-in and will hit you with multiple 
			spells and attacks.</p>
			
			<h3>Overgrowth/Unflinching</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/overgrowth.png" alt="Overgrowth">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/unflinching.png" alt="Unflinching">
			<p>Overgrowth increases your maximum health when units die 
			near you. Unflinching gives you bonus Tenacity and Slow Resist, 
			which increase with missing health. You should usually take 
			Unflinching into CC heavy comps. Overgrowth is better generally, 
			while Unflinching is better situationally.</p>

			<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration Secondary</h2>
			<p>Choose 2 of 3 runes.</p>
			
			<h3>Magical Footwear</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/magical-footwear.png" alt="Magical Footwear">
			<p>Magical Footwear gives you free Slightly Magical Footwear
			(boots) at 12 mins. This time decreases with the number of 
			takedowns. This heavily favours Camille. By getting free boots 
			slightly later in the game, you can buy other items and hit key 
			item spikes quicker.</p>
			
			<h3>Biscuit Delivery</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/biscuit-delivery.png" alt="Biscuit Delivery">
			<p>Biscuit Delivery gives you a Total Biscuit of Everlasting 
			Will every 2 mins, until 6 mins. Biscuits restore health and 
			mana when consumed. Biscuit Delivery is useful for the laning 
			phase.</p>
			
			<h3>Cosmic Insight</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/cosmic-insight.png" alt="Cosmic Insight">
			<p>Cosmic Insight gives Item and Summoner Spell Haste. This 
			is overall useful, especially since Camille usually takes
			teleport, which is the highest cooldown Summoner Spell in the 
			game and therefore is heavily affected by the bonus Haste.</p>
			
			<h2 id="stats">Stat Runes</h2>
			
			<h3>Adaptive Force/Attack Speed</h3>
			<img class="small-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/adaptive-force.png" alt="Adaptive Force">
			<img class="small-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/attack-speed.png" alt="Attack Speed">
			<p>Take Adaptive Force when you are taking more short trades 
			and fights; take Attack Speed in longer fights.</p>
			
			<h3>Adaptive Force</h3>
			<img class="small-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/adaptive-force-1.png" alt="Adaptive Force">
			
			<h3>Armor/Magic Resist</h3>
			<img class="small-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/armor.png" alt="Armor">
			<img class="small-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/magic-resist.png" alt="Magic Resist">
			<p>Take Armor against Physical damage heavy lanes/comps and 
			take Magic Resist against Magic damage heavy lanes/comps.</p>
			
			<!-- Items Section -->
			<h1 id="items">Items</h1>
			<h2 id="starting-items">Starting Items</h2>
			
			<h3>Doran's Shield Start</h3>
			<img id="item-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/dorans-shield.jpg" alt="Doran's Shield">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/health-potion.jpg" alt="Health Potion">
			<p>Start this in more passive, poke heavy lanes.</p>
			
			<h3>Doran's Blade Start</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/dorans-blade.jpg" alt="Doran's Blade">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/health-potion-1.jpg" alt="Health Potion">
			<p>Start this in more aggressive lanes. This is the more 
			common starting item.</p>
			
			<h2 id="core">Core Items</h2>
			
			<h3>Divine Sunderer/Trinity Force</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/divine-sunderer.jpg" alt="Divine Sunderer">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/trinity-force.jpg" alt="Trinity Force">
			<p>Divine Sunderer gives Attack Damage, Health, Ability Haste,
			and Armor and Magic Penetration. It empowers your next auto 
			attack after using an ability and heals you if the target is a 
			champion. Trinity Force gives Attack Damage, Attack Speed, Health, 
			Ability Haste, and Movement Speed. It grants you bonus Movement 
			Speed after auto attacking, and stacks bonus Attack Damage after 
			attacking a champion. It also empowers your next auto attack 
			after using an ability. Divine Sunderer is often preferred as 
			it favours Camille's short trade playstyle better. It also gives
			you healing, which is necessary as Camille is a relatively less
			durable fighter. Take Trinity Force against low health targets 
			that you need to stick closely to using the bonus Movement Speed.</p>
			
			<h3>Boots</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/plated-steelcaps.jpg" alt="Plated Steelcaps">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/mercury-treads.jpg" alt="Mercury Treads">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/lucidity-boots.jpg" alt="Ionian Boots of Lucidity">
			<p>Plated Steelcaps give Armor and reduce damage of incoming attacks.
			Mercury Treads give Magic Resist and Tenacity. Ionian Boots of 
			Lucidity give Ability Haste. Choosing which boots to buy is situational.
			Plated Steelcaps are better into Physical damage and auto attack heavy 
			lanes/comps, Mercury Treads are better into Magic damage and CC heavy 
			lanes/comps, and Ionian Boots of Lucidity are better when the bonus 
			Ability Haste (and therefore damage) is more desirable than durability.</p>
			
			<h3>Ravenous Hydra</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/ravenous-hydra.jpg" alt="Ravenous Hydra">
			<p>Ravenous Hydra gives Attack Damage, Ability Haste, and Life Steal. 
			It also allows your auto attacks to cleave, dealing damage to 
			surrounding enemies and healing you. This gives Camille much needed 
			pushing power, which allows you to push and pressure side lanes more.
			It also gives significant healing, which is necessary for Camille's 
			less durable nature.</p>
			
			<h2 id="other-items">Other Items</h2>
			
			<h3>Maw of Malmortius</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/maw-of-malmortius.jpg" alt="Maw of Malmortius">
			<p>Maw of Malmortius gives Attack Damage, Magic Resist, and Omnivamp.
			It also gives a Magic shield after falling below 30% health. When a 
			shield is given, you are given Omnivamp until the end of combat. The 
			Magic Resist and shield is especially useful against Magic Damage heavy
			comps. The Omnivamp is useful in giving healing to Camille. Note that 
			Maw of Malmortius cannot be bought with Sterak's Gage.</p>
			
			<h3>Sterak's Gage</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/steraks-gage.jpg" alt="Sterak's Gage">
			<p>Sterak's Gage gives Health and Attack Damage. It also gives a shield 
			after falling below 30% health. When a shield is given, you are given 
			Tenacity, both of which decay over time. Sterak's gives significant
			damage and durability to Camille and is in general a good item. Note 
			that Sterak's Gage cannot be bought with Maw of Malmortius.</p>
			
			<h3>Death's Dance</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/deaths-dance.jpg" alt="Death's Dance">
			<p>Death's Dance gives Attack Damage, Ability Haste, and Armor. With this
			item, damage you take is taken over a period of time instead. It also 
			heals you on takedowns. Death's Dance is a good durability and damage
			item, and the Armor is particularly good into Physical damage heavy comps.</p>
			
			<h3>Guardian Angel</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/guardian-angel.jpg" alt="Guardian Angel">
			<p>Guardian Angel gives Attack Damage and Armor. It revives you upon death
			with 50% base health and 30% max mana after 4 seconds. This is an extremely
			useful item as it gives Camille more damage and Armor, and allows her to 
			dive into teamfights more freely and aggressively.</p>
			
			<!-- Summoner Spells Section -->
			<h1 id="summoners">Summoner Spells</h1>
			<p>You will almost always go Teleport. It is a good Summoner Spell for top
			laners, as it allows you to return to lane quicker and thereby control it, 
			and it allows you to impact the rest of the map. Teleport also synergises 
			with Camille's split push nature well.</p>
			
			<h3>Teleport/Flash</h3>
			<img id="spell-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/teleport.jpg" alt="Teleport">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/flash.png" alt="Flash">
			<p>Flash instantly teleports you a short distance. It is useful for chasing
			kills and escaping death. Take Flash when there are key skillshots that 
			need to be dodged.</p>
			
			<h3>Teleport/Ignite</h3>
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/teleport-1.jpg" alt="Teleport">
			<img src="images/runes-and-items/ignite.jpg" alt="Ignite">
			<p class="bottom-text">Ignite deals True Damage over a period of time, and also applies Grievous
			Wounds. It is useful for getting and finishing kills. Take Ignite in volatile 
			matchups and lanes where you can look for kills, and whenever you don't need
			Flash.</p>
