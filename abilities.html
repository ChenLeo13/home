			<h2 id="auto-q">Auto Attack + Q</h2>
			<img id="auto-attack" src="images/abilities/auto.jpg" alt="Auto Attack">
			<img src="images/abilities/connector-image.png" alt="Connector Image">
			<img src="images/abilities/q-1.png" alt="Q Ability">
			<p>Camille's Q is an empowered auto attack. Empowered auto attacks can 
			be used as an auto attack reset. This means that the second auto attack
			(i.e. the empowered one) can land much faster than a normal follow-up 
			auto attack. This can be used in clutch situations where a few tenths 
			of a second can make the difference, or in simple short trade scenarios.
			Note that both Camille's Q1 and Q2 are empowered auto attacks, meaning 
			that they can both be used as an auto attack reset.</p>
			
			<h2 id="e-q2">E + Q2 (With Sheen)</h2>
			<img src="images/abilities/e-1.png" alt="E Ability">
			<img src="images/abilities/connector-image-1.png" alt="Connector Image">
			<img src="images/abilities/q2.jpg" alt="Q2 Ability">
			<p>Camille's empowered Q2 converts the following auto attack into True
			damage, meaning it ignores resistances. This significantly increases the
			damage, as resistances can often block anywhere from 30%-60% of damage.
			Since only the following auto attack is converted into True damage, you want
			this single auto attack to do as much damage to maximise the bonus. Sheen 
			empowers your next auto attack to do bonus damage after using an ability.
			After using E to engage an enemy, you may be tempted to do an auto attack
			reset (see <a class="norm-link" href="#auto-q">Auto Attack + Q</a>). However, 
			doing this uses your Sheen charge, as it triggers on the first unempowered 
			auto attack after you use your E and then goes on cooldown. On the other hand,
			using Q2 immediately after landing your E means that the bonus damage of Sheen
			is converted into True damage. This significantly increases your total damage
			output. Note that this also works for any item that Sheen builds into.</p>
			
			<h2 id="q-w">Q + W</h2>
			<img src="images/abilities/q-2.png" alt="Q Ability">
			<img src="images/abilities/connector-image-2.png" alt="Connector Image">
			<img src="images/abilities/w-1.png" alt="W Ability">
			<p>Camille's Q grants her bonus movement speed. This is very useful overall.
			It can be used to chase enemies, dodge skillshots, or disengage and kite away
			from fights. One common way it is used is to hit the outer edge of her W. 
			Note that the outer edge of the W deals bonus damage, slows, and heals Camille,
			so it is important to hit enemies on the outer edge. The bonus movement speed 
			helps Camille move and reposition during the delay of her W to hit enemies on 
			the edge. It can also be used to run toward enemies who are slightly out of range
			and hit her W.</p>
			
			<h2 id="w-e-flash">W/E + Flash</h2>
			<img src="images/abilities/w-2.png" alt="W Ability">
			<img src="images/abilities/e-2.png" alt="E Ability">
			<img src="images/abilities/connector-image-3.png" alt="Connector Image">
			<img id="flash-icon" src="images/runes-and-items/flash.png" alt="Flash">
			<p class="bottom-text">Both Camille's W and her E can be enhanced by using Flash 
			while casting. While both cases have their different uses, Flash is used to quickly
			reposition Camille and therefore her abilities to create quick and unexpected plays.
			Using Flash in the middle of her W cast-time allows her to quickly move to a different 
			position, which moves her W as well. This can be used to chase down enemies who are 
			out of range of her W, or to run away from enemies. Camille can also use Flash while 
			dashing with her E. This allows her to reposition at the last second and change her initial
			target landing. This allows her to target previously untargetable enemies. Camille 
			can Flash over enemies to hit a target behinding someone. Camille can Flash to increase
			the range of her E and hit enemies out of range. Camille can also Flash sideways to catch 
			enemies off guard who might expect the E to miss. Overall, combining Flash with Camille's 
			abilities makes her a more unpredictable and versatile champion.</p>
