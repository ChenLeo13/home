			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<p class="author">By Riot Games</p>
			
			<p>Clan Ferros understands sacrifice.</p>

			<p>Most of the family’s wealth came through harvesting a
			rare crystal from the Brackern, a creature native to Shurima.
			These hex-crystals—or “first crystals”—contained power 
			normally only wielded by those born with innate magical
			ability. After Camille’s great-great aunt lost an arm during
			an early expedition, her sacrifice inspired the Ferros family
			motto: “For family, will I give.”</p>

			<p>The Brackern were a limited resource, and Camille's 
			family had to augment the crystals they’d accumulated. 
			Utilizing shadow investments in chemtech and runic alchemy,
			they developed less powerful, but easier to make, synthetic
			hex-crystals.</p>

			<p>Yet there were consequences—synthetic crystal manufacturing
			has long been rumored to heavily contribute to the Zaun Gray.
			Furthermore, it was only through espionage, intimidation, and
			murder that Clan Ferros held its monopoly on this priceless
			commodity, and ensured its uninterrupted production in Zaun, 
			maintaining the family’s place in Piltover’s illustrious 
			Bluewind Court.</p>

			<p>As the eldest surviving child of Clan Ferros’ masters, 
			Camille received every educational advantage. She had exceptional
			tutors, learning to speak several foreign languages and 
			play the Cellovinna at a concert-master level. Camille also
			learned to read and write Ancient Shuriman while assisting 
			her father on digs in the Odyn Valley.</p>

			<p>Traditionally, one of the younger children would become
			their family's principal intelligencer, working with the 
			clan master to secure their family’s success by any means
			necessary. However, Camille's younger brother, Stevan, had
			a weak constitution, and so Camille took his place. He 
			jealously watched her embrace her additional training, and
			she became quite adept in combat, reconnaissance, and 
			interrogation.</p>

			<p>When Camille was twenty-five, augmented Zaunite thugs 
			attacked her and her father, intent on stealing lucrative 
			trade secrets. Camille’s father succumbed to his wounds, and
			in anguish, her mother died soon after. Stevan became clan 
			master, and he doubled the clan’s research in human hextech 
			augmentation, eager to prove himself as a strong leader.</p>

			<p>After a year of mourning, Stevan oversaw the induction of
			Hakim Naderi—a promising young crystallographer from the 
			Shuriman coastal city of Bel'zhun—as the family’s lead artificer.</p>

			<p>Camille requested hextech augmentation from Hakim to push 
			her beyond her human limitations. Hakim was instantly enamored
			with her, and they bonded over the preparations and late night
			stories of Shurima… and eventually, Camille returned Hakim's
			feelings. Their affair grew reckless, as they knew the surgery
			would conclude their time together. Hakim would move onto other
			projects, and Camille would once again be fully committed to 
			the principal intelligencer’s duties. More than that, Hakim
			worried that in carving away Camille's heart, he might remove
			her humanity.</p>

			<p>Days before Camille's operation, Hakim proposed marriage and
			begged her to run away with him. For the first time in her life,
			Camille was torn.</p>

			<p>Stevan had no such conflict, as he needed Camille to execute
			his vision. When he learned of the secret proposal, he devised a
			plan—the next time Camille and Hakim were together, Stevan set 
			himself up to be attacked. When she saw her brother bruised and 
			bloodied, Camille recognized what could happen when her attention
			was divided.</p>

			<p>Hakim pleaded with Camille, but she wouldn’t listen. For family,
			she would give. She ended her relationship with Hakim, insisting 
			her surgery go forward.</p>

			<p>He was the only one who could safely perform the operation, and
			so he excised Camille’s heart and replaced it with hextech—then 
			resigned. When she awoke, the lab she and Hakim had shared was
			abandoned.</p>

			<p>Camille focused on her work. She took on further refinements, 
			including bladed legs, grapple-spindled hips, and other, minor 
			hex-augmentations, leading some to wonder how much of the woman 
			was left. And as Clan Ferros amassed more power and wealth, Camille’s 
			missions became darker and more deadly.</p>
			
			<p>Thanks to her hextech heart, she did not age—but the years were
			not so kind to her brother. Yet even as Stevan's body grew more frail,
			his iron grip on the clan remained.</p>

			<p>Eventually, Camille uncovered the depth of Stevan's betrayal, and 
			realized his machinations were no longer in the family’s best interests. 
			In that moment, she discarded the last sentiment she felt toward her 
			brother.</p>

			<p>After installing her favorite grand-niece as clan master, Camille 
			now runs the family's public affairs as well as its more shady operations. 
			As a solver of... difficult problems, she embraces her more-than-human 
			transformation and the cutting judgment it affords her—but a strange, 
			mournful keening in her hextech heart may yet prove a troubling portent.</p>
			
			<p>Regardless, Camille refuses to sit idle, and gains invigoration from
			well-executed industrial espionage, a fresh-brewed cup of tea, and long
			walks in the Gray.</p>
